Thank you for taking on this overnight task. As always, your safety and the security of the house are of utmost importance. Please adhere strictly to the following rules:
<br>
<br>
1. Close all windows and doors before midnight (00:00).
<br>
2. Do not, under any circumstances, open the door or windows between 00:00 and 06:00.
<br>
3. If your things aren‚Äôt where you left them, calmly leave the room, and when you return, they should be back.
<br>
  4. If any of the paintings are upside down, burn them immediately.
  <br>
  5. Do not turn on the radio, if it turns on by itself, turn it off.
  <br>
  6. If you find notes with more rules, follow them, if they are signed by me "Mr. Whitaker", otherwise, don't follow them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remember, follow these rules exactly as they are. Your safety depends on it.
  <br>
  Thank you for your diligence and discretion. I trust you will find everything in order.
